# WaveletTransform
Wavelet transform for C#
This little library was made as a part of my master's thesis on wavelet filtration.
Coefficients for Daubechies functions were taken from here http://www.musicdsp.org/files/daub.h
Coefficients for other wavelets can be found here http://wavelets.pybytes.com/
